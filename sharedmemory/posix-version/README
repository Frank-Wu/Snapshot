DOCUMENTATION
================

this program implements buffer ring in shared memory with one-writer-one-reader mode. If there are multiple readers or writers, mutex should be inserted.

================
usage:
1. run "make" to build the code.
2. run "./producer [buffer_size*] [message_size*]" in one shell. (or run "./producer [buffer_size*] &")
3. run "./consumer [buffer_size*] [message_size*]" in another shell.

*required.

Experimentally, if the data type is integer, then the preferred buffer_size should be set to 10000, while the message_size should be set to 1000.
This is because a single CPU operation reads 1 page data, and the page size is usually set to 4KB, which is the size of 1000 intergers.


Notice:
1. The buffer_size parameter in producer and consumer program should be the same.
2. The semaphore is implemented with POSIX API, while the shared memory is implemented with System V API. Any other APIs, e.g., boost, is also practical.
