DOCUMENTATION
================

this program implements buffer ring in shared memory with one-writer-one-reader mode. If there are multiple readers or writers, mutex should be inserted.

================
usage:
1. run "make" to build the code.
2. run "./producer [buffer_size*]" in one shell. (or run "./producer [buffer_size*] &")
3. run "./consumer [buffer_size*]" in another shell.

Notice:
1. The buffer_size parameter in producer and consumer program should be the same.
2. The program is implemented with System V API. Any other APIs, e.g., POSIX, boost, is also practical.
2. Due to the restriction of *nix platform on SEM_UNDO, the count of semaphore operation per process is restricted to 32767 (unless reset).
